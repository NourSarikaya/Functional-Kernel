1)  Problem:  The file_read file_pos is incorrect because the file_pos never gets set to its current position (length+file_pos).
        
    Solution: This was a simple fix by updating the file_pos by adding length to file_pos before returning from the function.

2)  Problem:  C Syntax error (still compiles correctly, so it's hard to notice) where setting the size of a buffer with a 
              variable.    
        
    Solution: Initialize the buffer size directly with an integer instead of using a variable fixed the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)  Problem:  Terminal scrolling vertical shifting brakes when running counter. 
        
    Solution: Instead of implementing the vertical shifts inside terminal write, moved that to putc inside lib.c. This fixed the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4)  Problem:  Page error due to allocating too much memory (inode->length_bytes) on stack when filling in executable file's content into 
              filebuf (buffer that we used to obtain the correct EIP:byte 24-27)  
    
    Solution: Changes the size to allocate on stack to 40 (the header that's necessary to read), which fixed the stack memeory/page 
              issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5)  Problem:  Could not halt properly, moves on to execute again (for files that needs inputs - hello.exe) before current process is 
              over. 
    
    Solution: Need to flush the TLB, which fixed the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6)  Problem:  When restoring the registers in halt, the registers are not being restored with the correct values.
    
    Solution: The number of address offsets added weren't correct, changed to the correct offsets that fixed this issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7)  Problem:  Page Faulting when running system_halt.

    Solution: Set the esp to eip (which was wrong) instead of setting it to ebp. After making the change, the issue was fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8)  Problem:  Terminal read function was incorrect as the buffer passed in was treated as the filled keyboard buffer, not the empty
              terminal buffer to be filled (incorrectly switched the left and right hand side of the the equal sign).

    Solution: Using the getKeys() function to obtain the correct keyboard buffer values and passed in the empty terminal buffer to be 
              filled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9)  Problem:  Exit resulted in infinite booting of the MP4 machine (corrupted the kernal).
    
    Solution: Fixed the wrong movl instruction (which dereferencing invalide address) inside context_switch by spliting one movl
              operation into two: movl then add the offsets. This fixed the issue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10) Problem:  Counter didn't work because the buffer is always filled up with /0 (null characters), so nothing is being printed to
              screen.
    
    Solution: Also, caused by not flushing the TLB. Flushing the TLB properly fixed this issue.
